# Employee-Attrition-ML-project
An exercise in data analysis, machine learning and building an ensemble. 
This project aims to create a machine learning model that predicts employee attrition, and tenure at their work place. 
To improve performance metrics, the model relies on a Voting Classifier and Voting Regressor ensemble to make its predictions. 
ML algorithms used are: Logistic regression, Linear regression, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes and ridge regression.
